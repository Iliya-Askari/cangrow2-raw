1. Frontend Development
    Learn HTML5: semantic elements, forms, accessibility
    Learn CSS3: Flexbox, Grid, animations, responsive design, preprocessors like SASS or LESS
    Master JavaScript (ES6+): variables, functions, DOM manipulation, event handling, promises, async/await
    Learn a modern frontend framework/library: React (hooks, state management with Redux or Context API) or Vue.js or Angular
    Understand how to create appealing and visually seamless user interfaces (UI):
      UI principles: color theory, typography, spacing, layout
      Design systems and component libraries (e.g., MaterialUI, Chakra UI, Bootstrap)
    Practice building reusable interface components
    Learn version control with Git and GitHub
    Explore frontend build tools: Webpack, Babel, npm/yarn scripts
    Learn testing tools/frameworks for frontend: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for endtoend testing
    Get experience working collaboratively in teams (code reviews, pair programming, using agile tools like Jira)

2. Backend Development
    Learn one backend programming language and framework:
      JavaScript/TypeScript with Node.js and Express.js or NestJS
      Python with Django or Flask
      Ruby with Rails
      Java with Spring Boot
      PHP with Laravel
    Understand serverside logic and architecture
    Learn RESTful API design and optionally GraphQL
    Learn creating and managing databases:
      Relational databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL with understanding of SQL queries, indexing, normalization
      NoSQL databases: MongoDB or Redis
    Understand authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT, OAuth)
    Learn about application infrastructure:
      Basic understanding of server setup, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
      Containerization with Docker
      CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
    Explore server performance optimization and security best practices
    Learn backend testing: unit testing, integration tests

3. EndtoEnd and Deployment
    Develop skills to integrate frontend and backend for seamless user experiences
    Learn about state management and data flow between client and server
    Practice debugging and optimizing both frontend and backend applications
    Understand deployment strategies:
      Deploy web applications using platforms like Vercel, Netlify (frontend), Heroku, or cloud provider services
    Configure domain names, SSL certificates, and environment variables
    Monitor application health and errors using tools like Sentry

4. Soft Skills and Collaboration
    Master clear and effective communication in written and verbal form
    Work with design teams to translate UI/UX mockups into functional components
    Participate in code reviews and feedback cycles
    Use Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
    Collaborate using project management and version control tools
